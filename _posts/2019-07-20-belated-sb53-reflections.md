It's been way too long since my last jot and this reflection on my Super Bowl 53 predictions is hilariously late. 

### Bad predictions i.e. most of the predictions

1. A tight Rams 27-24 win in a moderately scoring game...
    - This was the widest margin of victory and lowest scoring Super Bowl that the Patriots have ever played
2. ...or a high-scoring 45-21 Patriots victory
    - See above except this was even further off. Wade Phillips and Bill Belichick put in defensive clinics
3. Doubts of Brady's clutchness against non-elite quarterbacks
    - Brady made arguably one of [his top 5 throws ever to set up the game's only touchdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZufziHTQ2k&t=29m13s). It didn't matter that it was in double coverage against two recent Pro Bowl defenders -- [Marcus Peters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Peters) and [Cory Littleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cory_Littleton). Brady decided the game with that throw. (Also, I'm obligated to post [this similar gem against the Ravens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtkCKj_29JA&t=6m50s))

### Kinda accurate predictions

Brady's stat line (71.4 Rating, 21/35, 262 yds, 0 TD, 1 INT) wasn't much better than Goff's (57.9 Rating, 19/38, 0 TD, 1 INT)([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_LIII)). You could say he played down to Goff's level. But you'd be hard pressed to say Brady had a bad game; unlike Goff, he asserted his greatness when his team needed him. 

Never doubt the GOAT. I'm glad my predictions were almost entirely wrong. [Tony Romo can keep his job.](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2019/01/tony-romo-nfl-prediction-accuracy-super-bowl)
