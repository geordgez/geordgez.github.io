Finally made a simple blog. Time to start jotting down ideas and thoughts here.

Things I like:
- Really simple foundation -- styling can come later
- Markdown support -- makes it a lot easier to create content
- Versioning everything with Git -- even tracking content

Testing: this is what code looks like: `code here`
