# About Me

I'm currently a Senior Consultant within the Commercial Analytics practice
of [Booz Allen Hamilton](https://www.boozallen.com/).
I typically operate at the intersection of mathematical modeling, software
development, business strategy, and data across a variety of industries.

I graduated from Harvard in 2016 with a bachelor's degree in Applied
Mathematics and Economics as well as a master's degree in Applied Mathematics.
I also took a healthy amount of computer science courses along the way.

Unless I'm watching sports, I prefer to be outdoors. I run fairly regularly
and target 35-40mpw when I'm not training. I'll also play pickup anything.
