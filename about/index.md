# About Me

I am currently an Associate on the Core Debt Strats team at 
[Deutsche Bank](https://www.db.com/usa/). 

I was previously a consultant within the Commercial Analytics practice
of [Booz Allen Hamilton](https://www.boozallen.com/) focusing on data 
science, automation, and orchestration to cybersecurity. 

I'm interested in the intersection of mathematical modeling, software
development, business strategy, and data.

I graduated from Harvard in 2016 with a bachelor's degree in Applied
Mathematics and Economics as well as a master's degree in Applied Mathematics.
I also took a healthy amount of computer science courses along the way.

Unless I'm watching sports, I prefer to be outdoors. I run fairly regularly
(Strava connections welcome!) and target 35-40mpw when I'm not training. 

I'll also play pickup anything.
