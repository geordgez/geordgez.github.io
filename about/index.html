<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<p>
  I'm currently a Senior Consultant within the Commercial Analytics practice
  of <a href="https://www.boozallen.com/">Booz Allen Hamilton</a>.
  I typically operate at the intersection of mathematical modeling, software
  development, business strategy, and data across a variety of industries.
</p>
<p>
  I graduated from Harvard in 2016 with a bachelor's degree in Applied
  Mathematics and Economics as well as a master's degree in Applied Mathematics.
  I also took a healthy amount of computer science courses along the way.

  Unless I'm watching sports, I prefer to be outdoors. I run fairly regularly
  and target 35-40mpw when I'm not training. I'll also play pickup anything.
